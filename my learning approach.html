<p class="p1">My approach to learning Russian</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">First, a caveat. No two individuals learn exactly the same way. What I'm describing may or may not work for you. I do think some basic principles hold true no matter what learning style you have:</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b>Consistency</b> - Russian is a notoriously difficult language for native English speakers. As in all difficult undertakings, consistency pays off. There's a sort of cognitive "compound interest" effect going on here. Small investments in time and effort have a huge effect when sustained over a long period of time.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li3"><b>Multiple approaches</b> - Face it, you're not going to learn the language like a native speaker. Even if you pack your bags and move to Russia today, you won't have the same experience as a child learning the language or his or her parents. However, as an adult you have more cognitive skills that can partially make up for the lack of childhood exposure to the language. Many of the skills come into play by making cross-connections within the material acquired through different means.</li>
  <li class="li3"><b>Follow a plan</b> - In addition to being consistent about doing some work on a daily basis, following a plan will be very helpful. As non-expert (I'm definitely including myself in that category!) you don't know what you don't know, so it's hard to make up your own plan for approaching the material. Many <a href="resources.html"><span class="s1">resources</span></a><span class="s2"> </span>are available for learning the language. Since it has been done before, why not learn from that experience?</li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">With that in mind, here's what I do:</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p5">Listening</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">I use the Pimsleur Russian audio series to listen to and repeat Russian conversational snippets. Pimsleur is breathtakingly expensive, but if you can acquire it, it's really quite good. My aim is to do 3-4 units a week from Levels 1-3. Often I just put it on while I do my workout at night. Pimsleur focuses heavily on listening and pronunciation skills up-front. For me, since I do a lot of reading-based work, this tends to be very complementary.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p5">Speaking practice</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">As a reticent speaker, I need more practice. The repetition practice in Pimsleur definitely helps. As does having a native-speaker for a tutor. When I began working with a tutor one year ago, I knew a modest amount of vocabulary and had a basic understanding of grammar. But with a year of being forced to actually speak the language for an hour a week, I'm beginning to lose some of my perfectionistic reluctance to actually speak the language. No matter how poor your pronunciation or your grammar, at least you're trying.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p5">Vocabulary</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Without vocabulary, your range of expression will be fairly limited. Here's what I do for vocabulary. First, I use <a href="anki.html"><span class="s1">Anki</span></a><span class="s2">,</span> every single day. I never miss a day. Every new word I encounter through listening, work with my tutor, reading, etc. goes into <a href="anki.html"><span class="s1">Anki</span></a><span class="s2">.</span> In addition to that, I'm taking a structured approach to purposely acquire new words in order of frequency. I use the <i>"Russian Learner's Dictionary: 10,000 words in frequency order"</i> by Nicholas Brown. Every day, I pick out the next 6 words in the list, look them up and make <a href="anki.html"><span class="s1">Anki</span></a><span class="s2"> </span>cards out of them. On the weekends, I add 7 words each day. My goal is to finish this 10,000 word corpus within 3 years.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p5">Grammar</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Russian grammar is complex and nuanced. There are entire grammatical and semantic concepts that are completely absent in English. For grammar, I've been going through the <i>New Penguin Russian Course</i> (<a href="nprc.html"><span class="s1">NPRC</span></a><span class="s2">)</span> which is a highly-regarded self-study course. When I encounter concepts that need more detail and examples, I turn to a variety of sources - my tutor, <span class="s2">YouTube,</span> or the excellent <i>"A Comprehensive Russian Grammar"</i> by Terence Wade.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">That's my approach.</p>
